# When does parsing need to take place and what does it need to start properly?
The parsing should take place in the backend after the user has entered the entire code piece to run. The front end 
should not do any parsing.

# What is the result of parsing and who receives it?


# When are errors detected and how are they reported?


# What do commands know, when do they know it, and how do they get it?


# How is the GUI updated after a command has completed execution?
